# Bioinformatics Analysis of a SARS-CoV-2 Virus Genome (Python Programming)

[Analysis_Report.ipynb](Analysis_Report.ipynb) contains the preliminary and exploratory analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Virus genome (Jupyter Notebook).

In addition, the folder [further_scripts](further_scripts) contains some foundational algorithms and data structures for mapping DNA sequencing reads using a reference genome (read alignment) or without using a reference genome (de novo assembly).
